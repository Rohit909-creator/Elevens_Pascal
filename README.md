# Elevens_Pascal Experiment

This is an experiment to create Pascal's Triangle using a new algorithm based on the number 11. This is used to test reasoning llms and their ability to solve mathematical problems creatively.

- Chatgpt, Gemini, Qwen3 kept on thinking to solve this problem but they couldn't.

- Claude solved it in 2s, And Deep Seek Solved it in 1mins approx.

- I created the theory, action plan on paper and I made it into working code in about 30-45 minutes.
